% PF ECAL Cluster Calibration using Boosted Decision Tree %

\section{Boosted Decision Tree}
write a simple introduction to explain how BDT works in ML and how it helps in PF cluster regression in correcting the cluster energies.

\section{ECAL Cluster Calibration}

%why do we need to calibrate the PF ECAL clusters
PF cluster regression is needed to count for the PF cluster energy lost due to tracker material, gaps, dead channels etc.

ML method used to the correction factor is BDT based on a semi-parameteric regression.

To estimate the correction, it is helpful to take that PF cluster is where a photon has deposited all its energy in one PF cluster. Then we can say that the correction for that PFcluster = Energy of gen photon / Energy of raw pf cluster.

%the sample of the used data
The 2024 calibration is done on Double Photon with No Material dataset sample produced centrally under CMSSW 13.3 %this is Run3 Winter24 miniAOD%
The calibration is done separately in barrel and encaps regions of the ECAL for  Full and ZS readout categories.   

The training  is done on NOPU sample. However the validation of the training was tested for both NOPU and PU cases.

%details of the training%


we can test the training by comparing the response and the resolution of the PF ECAL cluster after using the new correction (blue line), previous correction(green) to before correction (red).

generally we see that the current correction very close to the previous one.
