% what are GNN?

% where GNN can be used in ECAL?
%% for superclustering "Particle reconstruction", particle identification (identify the flavor of the particle), energy regression. 

% when do we perform energy correction?
%% after superclusters are formed, energy corrections are applied.
%% this correction account for the energy lost in gaps and upstream material .. etc
%% currently this calibration is done using BDT with semiparametric regression. (this work is covered in previous chapter)
%% new ML algorithm developed DRN (to use low level inputs (rechits) instead of high level inputs (describe EM showers))

% Energy corrections using Dynamic Reduction Network?
%% input features (rechits) are transformed into high dimensional latent space.
%% Then graphs are dynamically generated in the latent space.
%% the graph convolution are performed (includes message passing)
%% the info is aggregated over the graph using clustering and pooling.
%% => input: Rechit features (E,x,y,z) => output: Predict probability density of energy correction value.
%% slide 16 has resolution plot that compare BDT to DRN calibration. (using photon gun simulation with ideal detector calibration)

% How calibration using chi squre method is done?
%................................................

% How is it done using DRN?
%.........................

% what is the motivation for offline calibration?
%...............................................
% when plotting the resolution vs true energy for EH hadrons we can see that
%% the resolution is non linear
%%%* A "non-linear resolution" in calorimetry calibration refers to a method where the calibration constants applied to a calorimeter's signal
%%% are not a simple linear function of energy, meaning the relationship between the measured signal and the actual deposited energy is not a straight line,
%%% but instead exhibits curvature, requiring a more complex mathematical model to accurately convert signals to energy values;
%%% this is often necessary to account for inherent non-linearities in the calorimeter response,
%%% like variations in shower development at different energy levels or non-uniformities within the detector itself. (AI answer google)

%%%*a "calorimeter response" refers to the measurable signal produced by a calorimeter when a particle is completely absorbed within it,
%%% essentially representing the energy of the incident particle as a detectable output,
%%% typically in the form of light or electrical charge generated by the secondary particles produced in the particle shower;
%%% it is essentially how much signal is generated per unit of energy deposited in the calorimeter, and can vary depending on the type of particle being absorbed.*

% => check more general info about calorimeters see talk Calorimeters Energy measurement

% using  Chi square method, what are the energy/ Pseudorapidity dependent calibrationss?
% .........................................................................
%%%* In statistics, minimum chi-square estimation is a method of estimation of unobserved quantities based on observed data.
% => source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_chi-square_estimation
%% Energy dependent calibration: slide 5 
%% EH hadrons: E(corrected):a* E(raw Ecal) + b*E(raw Hcal) + O(EH) 
%% H hadrons: E(corrected): c*E(raw Hcal) + O(H)
%%% * coeffiecent O: accounts for the energy lost beacuse of the energy thresholds of the clustering algorithm.
%%% * coeffiecent a,b,c could be estimated using a large sample of simulated particles
%%% after getting the coeffiecents we can apply the corrections on the raw ECAL & HCAL energies. 


% types of calibration?
%.....................
% => check pg 47 Source: calorimetry for particle physics

%%%* Absolute calibration of a calorimeter is a process that determines the constants needed to convert raw ADC codes into energy depositions
%%% in the calorimeter counters. The goal is to ensure accurate measurements of heat changes in chemical reactions or physical processes. (AI answer google)

\section{HCAL Cluster Calibration using GNN}

Hadronic showers in the CMS detector have both electromagnetic and hadronic components.

These showers are not dully contained in the ECAL but extend to HCAL.

The detector response is different for EM and HAD componenets which lead to non linear energy response.

The reconstructed energy of hadrons is the sum if all reconstructed hits (offline, PF reconstruct the RAW data) from the ECAL and HCAL.

For a given bin of ture energy (PF also reconstruct generated data or MC data):

by fitting the distribution of total RAW energy with Gaussian we obtain mu and std deviation then use them to get:

Resolution (std/mu) : which is a measure of accuracy

and Response [(mu/E true) -1] : which is measurement of precision. (we can see that is not linear)

Energy Reconstruction using conventional method (chi square) vs DRN (based on GNN).

The work in this thesis is done for Run3 data.

  % side notes: reviewing other materials

  % How is physics analysis is done at the LHC?
  %% to study particles like Higgs boson, we need to be able to reconstruct such an event from inside the detector.
  %% this means we need to reconstruct the possible final products of Higgs decay: photon & pair of muon (decay products of Z)
  %% other things we need to reconstruct to do other analysis: electrons, hadrons.

  % How can we reconstruct collision events from the detector signals?
  %% By using Particle flow algorithm we can get an event description.
  %% PF uses info from each cms sub detector to identify and reconstruct the final products that have interacted with the detector. (5 types of particles)
  %% PF uses different algorithms to first reconstruct the elements: tracks, clusters and then to link them to form the PF blocks.
  %% from these blocks we can get the list of the PF particle candidates that could be analyized further
  %to get Hight level objects that should look similar to the event initial products ex: jets, MET.

  % How hadrons deposit energy in the CMS?
  % Why the calibration of hadrons clusters is important?
  % What methods are used in calibrating the energy of hadrons clusters?
  % What architecture used in GNN?
  % How can we imporve the GNN method?
  % How can we validate the results of the GNN training?

  % summary:
  %% this work shows the promising imporvment in hadron cluster calibration by using GNN.

%\section{Captions}
%Figures are funny. They are notably different from tables and therefore requires some explanation. Here are the rules:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The caption is below the image
%\item The caption is centered if it's short, ie one line. 
%\item But if the text spans multiple lines, then it's left-justified. 
%\end{enumerate}

%Figure~\ref{figure_example1} has a short caption, and
%Figure~\ref{figure_example2} has a longer caption, demonstrating the required
%single-spacing.

%\begin{figure}[ht]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=1in]{baylor}
%\caption{This is a caption for this figure}
%\label{figure_example1}
%\end{figure}

%Figures like tables are floats and can be positioned anywhere. 
%This author favors placing images at the top. 
%But to illustrate, figure~\ref{figure_example2} is placed at the bottom. 

%\begin{figure}[b]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{baylor}
%\caption[The short table of contents version]{An example of a longer figure
%caption that spans multiple lines and has a corresponding short version for the
%table of contents.}
%\label{figure_example2}
%\end{figure}

%\section{Tables}

%Table~\ref{table_fruit} and Table~\ref{table_silly} demonstrate tables. Table
%captions differ slightly from figure captions, in that they are \textit{always}
%supposed to be centered, even if they use multiple lines.

%\begin{table}[h]
%\centering
%\caption[Fruits by color]{\centering Fruits listed by their color. Note that
%captions differ from figure captions in that they are \textit{always} supposed
%to be centered, even if they use multiple lines.}

%\begin{tabular}{rl}

%    Fruit & Color  \\  \hline

%    Red & Cherry \\
%    Green & Apple \\
%    Yellow & Banana \\
%    Purple & Eggplant \\
%    \hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}

%Tables can be anywhere in the text. They should be referred to \textbf{before} they make an appearance. 
%Tables can be placed between text, top of page, or bottom of page. This author personally prefers bottom of page. 
%There has to be triple space before the table captions, double space between caption and table, and triple space after the table. 

%The intext table (table~\ref{table_silly}) might look like it has more space after the table and before the text
%But that's just because the last item on the table is a horizontal line. 

%At the bottom of this page, is an example of a table set to [b]. This demonstrates the prettiness available to us by using tables at the bottom. 
%Bottom tables rock. As do top tables.
