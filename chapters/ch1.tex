The field of High Energy Physics (HEP), also known as elementary particle physics,
focuses on the study of the fundamental particles that make up the universe and their interactions via the basic forces of nature.

The quest for the smallest constituent of matter has its route back to the time of ancient Greece;
however, scientific attempts to understand the smallest constituent of matter started in much more recent time.
%
Particle physics emerged as a field of scientific study in the early 20th century,
when scientists began to probe the subatomic structure of matter.
%
Later, developments
of high-energy particle accelerators such as the cyclotron and the synchrotron, allowed
for the study of particles at ever-higher energies and smaller scales.
%
The Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland is currently the largest and highest energy particle accelerator.









%Here is the introduction to the topic.
%When chapters are referenced, the graduate school requires that words are used rather than numbers, e.g. ``Chapter One'' should be used instead of ``Chapter 1.''
%Use the command \verb|\cref| to reference chapters, for example \verb|\cref{chapter:ch1}|.
%The outline is as follows.
\cref{chapter:ch2} is about paragraphs and sections.
\cref{chapter:ch3} discusses footnotes and citations.
\cref{chapter:ch4} presents floats.
\cref{chapter:ch5} talks about lists.
\cref{chapter:ch6} is the conclusion.
