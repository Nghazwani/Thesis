When we collide particles at high energies inside a particle detector, the collision products either will decay into a stable particle that can be detected or
simple would not interact with the detector. 

(collision products could be: a heavy particle that decays into a stable particle like tau,
or jet of long lived particles (charged hadrons, photons from neutral pions, neutral hadrons) produced when a quark/gluon hadronizes,
or particles that don't intereact with the detector like neutrinos)


most of the collision products decay into more stable particles
(either from a heavy lepton like tau or jet of particles produced quarks/ gluons that could not be separated)
These final state particles could be detected by a particle detect like CMS detector.
