% notes about this source:

% pg 6 energy reconstruction using classical method (chi squre minimization method) 
weight factors minimize a chi square.

%% In particle physics "fluctuations of showers" refers to: the unpredictable variations in the development of a particle shower,
%% which is a cascade of secondary particles created when a high-energy primary particle interacts with matter
%% causing the number of particles within the shower to fluctuate significantly due to the probabilistic nature of the underlying interaction processes involved.

% pg 7 DRN
based on dynamic graph neural network
the model maps the input features onto a higher dimensional latent space, and adds clustering and pooling steps to aggregate information.

input features:
energies E
coordinates of individual cells (rechits) (x,y,z) 

model traget: E true/E fix 
model output: E pred/E fix
E (true): true energy of particle. 
E (fix): reconstructed energy using detector level calibration. (??)
%% ^ is that related to HLT correction? 
E (pred): energy reconstruction using DRN weights.

loss function: (target-prediction)^2/target
%% ^ review loss/cost function from ML notes.

the model is trained using:
flat energy sample of 10-350 GeV
4.1M simulated events

AdamW optimizer with a constant learning of 0.0010
about ~63K parameters for the model to learn

% pg 10
The distribution of the reconstructed energy is fitted with gaussian function to obtain (mean) sigma (std div)
relative resolution sigma/mean, response mean/ E(true).

the procedure done independently in data, simulation. 

% pg 13
adding spatial coordinates gives DRN info about the spatial development of the shower which helps DRN to better compensate the fluctuations and leakage.
%% ^ review shower fluctions from the instrumentation for high energy phsyics. 

% pg 14
comparing the energy reconstructed to the true energy: 300 GeV
DRN(4 inputs)= 296 GeV
chi squre= 372 GeV

% pg 15
the energy deposition patterns of hadrons are knonw to have a high degree of fluctuations, and complexity in terms of particle multiplicity and evolution of showers.
this could be more complicated by potential leakage if energy if the detector is not sufficiently instrumented.

the algorithms are based on GNNs called dynamic reduction network architecture. 
this method improves the energy resolution when compared to chi square method.

% DRN architecture (my talk)
Rechits -> NN mapping into latent space -> graph generation -> graph convolutions -> graph clustering & pooling -> output NN -> network output
%% ^ reviewing the GNN paper
