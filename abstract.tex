ECAL and  HCAl are one of the sub detectors of the cms experiments.
The ECAL is designed to measure the energies of electrons and photons.
The HCAL measures the energy of “hadrons”
    
an algorithm called Particle Flow is used for  CMS detector to reconstruct and identify all produced particle.

Clustering is done in the ECALand in HCAL
PF clusters need to be calibrated to count of missing energy due to tracker material, gaps, dead channels etc.
ML algorithms like : BDT & GNN are used in calibrating the PF clusters.
These ML methods improve the response, resolutions of the measured energy.
    
In this thesis BDT used for ECAL Cluster Calibration. in general the existing calibration derived from 2022 samples seems to continue working well.
looked at difference between the HLT (online) vs offline ECAL PF clusters.used Run3 sample
    
Also GNN used for Hadronic Cluster Calibration using +add conclusion+
