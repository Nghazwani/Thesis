%I want to express my great appreciation to several people.


I am honored to have the privilege to continue my education and to part of the science community that tries to know more about our universe. 
Pursing this journey has been a goal of mine for many years and would not been possible without the support of many people along the way. 

First, I would like to thank the graduate committee at Baylor university for giving me the opportunity to be part of their program. This experience had a hug impact on my personal and professional life. I would like specially thank Dr. Hilton and Dr. Mathews for their continues support and inspiration. (to be continue)
