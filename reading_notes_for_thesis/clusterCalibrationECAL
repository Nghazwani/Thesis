source: Calibration and Performance of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter in LHC Run2 (2020)
=============================================================================================

abstract:
........
1) many physics analyses that depend on CMS detector require high resolution of particles energy measurements.. (like electrons, photons)
1.1) this is important for studying the higgs boson decays tp EM particles
1.2) also searches for very high mass resonances decaying to energetic EM particles.
=> high energy resoultion is important.

2) the energy response of the calorimeter has been calibrated using full Run2 data
.. aiming at legacy reprocessing of the data.
2.1) dadicated calibration of each detector channel has been performed using physics events like:
.. electrons from W/Z boson decays
.. photons from pi0 or eta decays
.. the asimuthally symmetric energy distribution of minimum bias events

intro:
.....
1) ECAL in the CMS
2) Crystal calorimeters & channel to channel energy calibration.
3) ECAL is equipped with a laser light injection system
.. monitors crystal transparency every 40 minutes

1) The CMS
..........
1.1 cms is a multipurpose detector at LHC.
1.2 it is designed to test the SM and to search for physics beyond the SM.

2) ECAL
.......
2.1 crucial for precision measurement involving electrons and photons. 
2.2 also for the reconstruction of the jets energy and the event MET.
2.3 ECAL is a compact, hermtic, homogeneous, high granularity "lead tungstate crystal" detector
-------------------
2.3.1 Barrel region
-------------------
*coverage |eta| < 1.48
*total ~ 61000 crystals
*36 supermodules (1700 channels in each)
*avalanche photo Diode photosensors (APD)
** each crystal referred to as a channel
-------------
2.3.2 Endcaps
-------------
*coverage 1.48 <|eta| < 3
*total of ~14500 crystals
*4 half disk (shaped like D) (3662 channels)
*vacuum photo triode photosensors
--------------
2.3.3 preshower
--------------
*coverage 1.65 <|eta| < 2.6 (fits before the endcap)
*total ~ 137000 si strips
*two lead si planes 
2.4 designed to achieve excellent energy resolution for electrons and photons.

3) LHC Run2 Conditions (Run3?) 
......................
=> luminosity:
* measure of the number of the interactions.
** instantaneous L: number of collisions in 1s.
** integrated L: totak number of collisions produced over a period of time.
(source: https://home.cern/news/news/physics/why-precision-luminosity-measurements-matter#:~:text=Luminosity%20is%20a%20measure%20of,over%20a%20period%20of%20time.)

3.1 during Run2 luminosity increased 2-4 times comparing to Run1.
3.1.1 which means increase pileup
3.1.2 increase radiation damage (larger noside, reduced the crystals light output , becomes less transparent)

3.2 to maintain a stable energy scale, and achieve the required energy resolution
3.2.1 continuous monitoring of the detector response needed 

4) energy reconstruction
4.1 EM energy is reconstructed with a dynamic clustering algorithm (ML method) to form a basic cluster
4.2 EM showers are spread over several crystals
4.3 basic clusters are extended in phi direction (covering a ring) to form a superclusters
4.3.1 to cover additional energy spread due to magnetic field (photon conversion, electron bremsstrahlung)
4.4 Energy(electron,photon) =
.. cluster correction factor *[scale factor from conversion*(reconstructed signal amplitude*laser coorection*intercalibration)+preshower energy]

5) single amplitude reconstruction
5.1 the multifit method is less sensitive to out of time pileup than weight method, and has better energy resolution in Run2 condition.

6) laser correction
6.1 this correction is to take into account crystals and photodetector response changes due to LHC irradiation
6.2 laser pulse is transmitted to a module through the optical fibers
6.3 response measurement for each of the crystals in ECAL is available every 40 mins

7) intercalibration
7.1 correction facor to equalize the ECAL response for different crystals at the same eta corrdiate (same distance form collision pipe)
7.2 several methods are used for performing intercalibration (not related to the thesis work)
7.2.1 phi symmetry
7.2.2 pi0 mass (invariant mass reconstructed) 
7.2.3 E/p (of high energy electrons) ration of the reconstructed energy in ECAL/momentum in the tracker
7.2.4 Z-> ee (invariant mass reconstructed)
7.3 final inercalibration obtained from combination of different methods by weighting their respective precision

8) preshower calibration
8.1) preshower response decrese with time due to tadiation damage

9) ECAL performance
9.1 => stability of the energy scale (invariant mass of Z)
9.2 => improvements in energy resolution (std dev/E)

summary
=> ECAL response overtime should be stable with very little spread
=> resolution for the electrons energy (smaller %)
