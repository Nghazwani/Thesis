===============
1. Advanced algorithms are used in the reconstruction and the calibration of calorimeter clusters ,basic PF elements, in the preshower, ECAL, HCAL.

2. just a reminder of the PF elements:
2.1 charged particle tracks, vertices (PV), tracking of electrons & muons. {tracks} 
2.2 calibrated calorimeter clusters {clusters}

# remember main foucs is on cluster calibration!

3. quick review of the calorimeter clusters pg 16-17
...........................................
3.1 the purpose of the clustering algorithm in the calorimeter:
3.1.1 detect, measure the energy and direction of the stable neutral particle. (the only way to detect them is to use calorimeter)
..... like: photons, neural hadrons.
3.1.2 separate neutral particles from charged hadrons energy
3.1.3 reconstruct and identify electrons + bremsstrahlung photons. (EM showering particles, superclusters)
3.1.4 help the measurement of charged hadrons where the track parameters were not accurate (case of high pt tracks, low quality)  

3.2 the used clustering algo in PF event reconstruction, has high detection for:
3.2.1 low energy particles
3.2.2 separating close energy deposit (good resolution)

3.3 the clustering is performed separately in each subdetector
3.3.1 ECAL barrel and endcaps.
3.3.2 HCAL barrel and endcaps.
3.3.3 two preshower layers.
3.3.4 no clustering in HF (directly gives rise EM or HAD cluster)

3.4 mention of the clustering algorithm parameters (includes threshold values, gaussian width))

3.5.1 "cluster seeds" are first identified as cells with energy larger than the given threshold, also larger than neighbouring cells.
..... neighbouring cell either: 4 cells that share a side (like in the HCAL) or 8 including the corners.
3.5.2 "topological clusters" are grown from the seeds by aggregating cells with:
..... at least a corner in common with a cell already in the cluster
..... and energy twich the noise level.
..... in the encdcaps noise level increases as a function of theta, added a requirement for the seed

3.6 expectation-maximization algorithm => based on "Gaussian-mixture model"
3.6.1 this algorithm is used to reconstruct the clusters within a topological cluster. = total energy of the particle before entering the calorimeters

=> the my notebook details of the PF reconstruction of energy deposit clusters.
* it shows the PF elements and their connection

4. Calorimeter cluster calibration pg 18-21
..................................

4.1 calorimeter clusters "separated" from the position of any charged particle track => clear signature of "neutral particles".
... in the event example: pi0, K0l.
4.2 neutral particles energy deposits overlapping wirh charge particle clusters can be detected if:
... there is an energy excesses with respect to the sum of the associated momenta (tracker)

=> accurate calibration of the calorimeter response to "photons" & "hadrons" is important to:
... maximizing the probability to identify the neutral particles while minimizing the rate of misreconstructed energy excesses.
... to get the right energy scale for all "neutral particles"
... (when identifyinf particles from PF blocks neural hadrons are the last one to reconstruct)

=> calibration of the Electromagnetic & hadron cluster will be described in the next sections.

4.3  Electromagnetic deposits (in ECAL)
-----------------------------
4.3.1 calibration done prior to the start of the collision data taking
... types: "absolute calibration of ECAL response to e,gamma" + "cell to cell relative calibration"
... done by: "test beam data" , "radioactive sources" , "cosmic ray"

4.3.2  "clustering algortihm" applies several thresholds to the ECAL cell energies.
... (these threshold related to the trigger system check source: https://cds.cern.ch/record/687490/files/note03_001.pdf)
4.3.2.1 => energy measured in clusters of ECAL cells is expected to be smaller than of the incoming "photons" {true energy}
        => also smaller than the superclusters {account for radiation} used for the absolute ECAL calibration.
...(check source for superclusters in ECAL: https://cds.cern.ch/record/2792321/files/DP2021_032.pdf?version=2)
4.3.2.2 "cluster algorithm" calibration  is accounting for the effects of the thresholds
....... how is done: using simulated simulated sigle photons.
....... when is applied: to all ECAL clusters before the hadron cluster calibration & particle identification step. (before reconstecting Egamma)

4.3.3 large samples of single photons with energies (0.25-100 GeV) processed through GEANT4 simulation of the CMS detector.
... only photons that do not go through conversion (pair production) before entering ECAL are considered in the analysis.
... due to the previous reason we only deal with calibration of single clusters

4.3.4 in the ECAL barrel region:
1.using analytical function that has E, eta as parameters
2.the function is fitted to 2D distribution of average of E{true}/E in the (E,eta) plane. (still only using photons in this study)
====================================================================================================================================
... using chi square method:(a statistical method used to optimize the parameters of a physics model by finding the set of values that minimizes the difference between the model's predictions and the observed data)
... (essentially by calculating a "chi-square" value and adjusting parameters until it reaches its lowest point; this is a common technique for calibrating detector components and analyzing particle physics data to extract the best possible information from the measurements)
====================================================================================================================================
3. the function f that is fiited to the distribution is the correction that need to applied to the measured cluster energy.
3.1 this correction should be closer to unity at high energy {where threshold effects vanish}
3.2 the correction could be as large as +20% at low energy

4.3.5 in the ECAL end region:
1. here the calibrated cluster energy is expressed as a function of the measured energies in the ECAL + in the preshower layers
... there 3 calibration paraeters depending on the energy (true) and eta (true) of the generated photon
