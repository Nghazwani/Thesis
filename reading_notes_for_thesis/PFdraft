# J ~ Object Reconstruction in CMS => PF algorithm, 4 paragraphs
================================================================
1) PF algorithm is a key feature of the CMS detector. (give an introduction on the reconstruction algorithm)
* check intro source from https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2438/1/012100/pdf
* Also into here https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2023-lesson-advobjects/02-particleflow/index.html
1.2) PF aims to reconstruct and identify all the particles produced in an event.
1.3) this is done by utilizing info coming from different subdetectors. since particles leave different signtures in different subdetectors. 

2) PF is a multiple process algorithm that uses a combination of varies info from the subdetectors.
2.2) it starts with reconstructing charged particles using info from tracker subdet (measure trajectory and momentum of the particles as they move in magnetic field)
2.3) then identify photons and electrons. which reconstructed using info from ECAL (measure energy of the particle through electromagentic interactions)
2.4) hadronic particles like mesons and pions are reconstructed using info from HCAL (measure energy of the particles through their hadronic interactions)

3) The PF combines info from ECAL & HCAL to reconstruct hadronic jets.
3.2) jets contian streams of particles produced through hadronization of quarks and gluons.

4) final step the remaining energy that is not accounted by the identified particles is attributed to the presence of undetected nautral particles like neutrinos.

5) once all the particles are reconstructed and identified
5.2) PF will combine the info to obtain best measurement of each particle energy and momentum.

6) this info wull be used to study the properties of particle produced in the pp collisions
6.2) for example masses, lifetime, interactions.
6.3) also search for new physics BSM, tested predictions of theoretical models with high precision. 

7) PF improve the reconstruction of the objects which enable wide range of physics analyses with high sensitivity and precision.

# B ~ Event Reconstruction => PF (3 paragraphs) , Reconstruction of physics objects, event filters and corrections.  
intro: Event Reconstructio
..........................
1) the purpose of the event reconstruction, translate detector readout into info of particles produced in the collisions.
1.2) this is done by using info from the all subdetectors and build an event description that constains produced particles form the collision.

2) several topics are covered that are related to the reconstruction of the data event.
2.2) particle flow link tracks from the silicon tracker and deposited energy clusters in cal, and muon detector and for a set of identified particles.
2.3) these topics: PF description, PF candidates further refined into reconstructed physics objects which will be suitable for analysis.
2.3.1) this refinement if specific to  the type of the particle and involves passing selective identification criteria, algorithm clustering, ML bassed classification.
2.4) list of the physics objects and their criteria will be utilize in the analysis discussion.
2.5) lastly event filters due to anomaly or reconstruction issues, and corrections to the simulated data are discussed.
..........................
expand on 2.2) ~ PF (3 paragraphs)
.........................
1) the output of the PF algorithm is a list of the PF candidates. (5 particles)
1.2) PF utilize an order of operations and several techniques specific to the type of candidate to produce the output (refining the objects?)
1.3) (before the previous step) PF need to reconstruct high level info from the raw data.
1.3.1) this is devided into 3 categories: track reconstruction, calorimeter clustering, linkage of this information.

2) tracking reconstruction:
2.1) hits => associated according to an iterative tracking algorithm, based on the Kalman filter, to reconstruct the path of a charged particle (track)
2.2) similary, muons are charged particles. their tracks could be traced in the inner tracker and from hits (pieced together) in the outer muon detectors.
2.3) using track info will be achieve high levels of momentum resolution for charged particles.

3) calorimeter clustering:
3.1) electrons, photons, hadrons interact with the absorptive materical in the calorimeters.
3.2) this interaction create a spray of particles in a recurrent fashion till all energy has dissipated.
3.3) this will result in depositing the products of the origional particle across multiple channels in the ECAL & HCAL.
3.4) PF create clusters from the calorimeter cells based on the magnitude of the deposited energy.
4.5) the previous step (clustering) is porcessed separately.

4) linking algorithm:
4.1) PF implements a linking algorithm to connect tracks with clusters from different subsystems.
4.2.1) tracks could be associated with ECAL or HCAK clusters.
4.2.2) ECAL clusters could be combined with HCAL clusters.
4.2.3) muon tracks can be connected to with compatible with tracks from the inner tracker.
4.2) this level of information is referred to as PF blocks.

5.1) PF pieces this info (blocks) to identify the type of the particle interacting with the detector.
5.2) for PF order of operations matter.
5.2.1) PF candidate with cleanest signture is identified first. then the next cleanest signature and so on.
5.2.2) the PF clocks related to the identified PF candidate are removed from the algorithm when considering the next potential candidate. 
=> PF is a complex algorithm but in general 
5.2.3) muon candidates are reconstructed first, then electrons, charged hadrons, photons and neutral hadrons.

5.3.1) Muons:
.. detectable signtures are in the inner tracks and muon systems.
.. so muon tracks and compatible inner tracks are reconstructed as PF muons. 

5.3.2) Electrons:
.. passively interact with inner tracker,are absorbed by the ECAL subdetectors.
.. electrons are identified using a gaussian sum filter which accounst for the energy loss due to braking radiation,bremsstrahlung.
.. ECAL clusters are matched to the elctron track according to the track trajectory and energy.
.. from these info the PF electrons are reconstructed.

5.3.3) charged hadrons:
.. will interact with the inner traacker, then  deposit some energy in the ECAL and the remaining energy in the HCAL.
.. since the electron & muon has been identified, the remaining tracks in the inner tracker should come from charged hadrons.
.. the track trajectory is matched to the closest HCAL and ECAL clusters.
.. if the tracker energy is higher than the sume of the energy in the calorimeter clusters then nearby ECAL that are compatible with the tracker energy will be added gradually
till the energy will match.
.. then charged hadrons are reconstructed.

5.3.4) photons:
.. photons have no tracks, they deposit their energy in the ECAL.
.. checking the remaning the ECAL clusters that are not associated with HCAL clusters will be constructed as photons.

5.3.5) neutral hadrons:
.. similar to photons have no tracks but they will deposit their energy in the ECAL & HCAL.
.. the remining ECAL and HCAL cluster which georgraphically connected will be reconstructed as neutral hadrons.

6) after going through the PF algorithm, the event description has been transformed from raw infor of detector hits to list of particles
6.1) this list is made of particles that are likely interacted with the detector.

7) however there still room to refine this further and reconstruct the higher level physics objects that were produced directly from the hard process.
7.1) these physics objects inclued:
7.1.1) primary vertex (hard process)
7.1.2) Missing tranverse momentum.
7.1.3) muons
.. in addition to the criteria set by the PF 
.. reconstructed muons pass more stringent identification and isolation requirements. 
7.1.4) electrons
7.1.5) Jets
.. quarks are produced and will undergo hadronization.
.. The eï¬€ect is a spray of particles in a cone-like shape which is referred to as a jet.
.. these particles will be mostly in the form of charged and neutral hadrons.
.. jets are reconstructed by clustering PF candidates according to the anti Kt algorithm.
.. (jets reconstuction is not simple)
7.1.6) b-jets
.. heavy flavor jets are jets originating from b or c quarks.
.. while light flavor originating from u,d,s quarks or gluons.

# C ~ Event REconstruction => Physics objects 

1) the next step after getting the collision data or simulated data is to reconstruct and identify the stable particles produced in the event.
1.1) PF is a dadicated algorithm that is used in the CMS for this purpose, PF output reconstructed candidates of:
electons, muons, photons, charged hadrons, and neutral hadrons.
1.2) with detemining their direction, energy, type.
1.3) once we have the list of the PF candidates we can use them to reconstruct more complicated objects such as jets.

2) info from the tracker and calorimeter systems are critical for the PF reconstruction.
2.1) hits => in the tracking subdetector are used to reconstuct the initial path of particles from the primary vertex through CMS
.. by the iterative tracking algorithm.
2.2) the ECAL & HCAL meaures the energy of the particles that pass through the tracking system by absorbing them.
.. these hits in the calorimeter system are then clusterd together to fully reconstuct the energy deposited in multiple channels using a clustering algorithm.
2.3) the info from these two independent algorithms then linked together along with the hits meaured by the muon systems.
,, using linking algorithm
.. to eventually reconstuct the path, energy, type of the particles that came from the primary vertex.

3) PF take advantage of the fact that each particle type leaves a unique signature in the detector (use known figure)
3.1) ex: neutral hadron will no leave a track in the tracking system or large deposit in the ECAL but will leave hits in the HCAL.

4) once the PF algorithm creates the initial list of reconstucted particles for each event
4.1) usually there is a further processing of the objects to filter out undesirable or misidentified objects.
.. this step is analysis dependent, details of the requirements are uniquie to the thesis.

5) some events will suffer from a large amount of detector noise or reconstruction failures that should be filtered out.

6) for simulated events, the weight can be modified to acount for discrepancies between collision data and MC data.
.. know as event reweighting or applying scale factor
.. MC data corrections can be applied by deriving a set of scale factors that change the weighting of simulated evenets such that it matches the observed data prediction.
